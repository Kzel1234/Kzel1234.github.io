<!-- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  I enjoyed creating a wireframe and Html page as a pair. It brought different ideas to the project that would have otherwised been a missed opportunity.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes. Wireframing was very useful for eventually building the HTML page

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
Something that was clean, and organized. Nothing should be hard to understand in a wireframe.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
The new HTML5 tags such as <aside> and <nav>
