What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned more about the difference between the 3, and how to manipulate the distance between them.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
That it's really hard. It's a lot of trial and error to get things to go exactly where you want them to.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Backgound colors were definitely the easiest. Again, the most difficult thing was by far the positioning.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
That a single html file can have 2 stylesheets.
